# WEBDEV getting started


So you want to make a webpage. You want your own domain.  You want it all!  This is a 1 hour long tutorial to get you up and running and developing with some nice tools. 


##1)  Tools

* [atom.io](http://atom.io)

  is a great code editor, it is cross platform and looks pretty.

* [git](http://git-scm.com)  
  git is a code collaboration tool but also will allow us to use github to host our pages! If you already have git then you can skip this step.
  1.  Got to [github.com](http://github.com) and create an account if you don't have one already.
  1.  Install the github app from here: [Mac](http://mac.github.com) or [PC](http://windows.github.com).
  1.  Run GitHub app, and set up with your new account.
  1.  Go to Preferences -> Advanced and fill in your information with the same email you used for your github account and then click "Install Command Line Tools"
